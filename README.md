# Palo_Alto_Scripting
Updates PaloAlto device ACL's. Logs in to multiple firewalls, returns permitted-ip profiles: 
user batch updates interface ACL's in a customized manner, by passing in lists/nested lists of ip_address/username/password,
and white-listed ip addresses to push permitted-ips. 


We can specify defferent interface profiles to update for different firewalls, so we have a fair bit of customization options.


Will soon be adding black-list, rollback, service policy, ip blackholing, and connectivity features (tests connectivity after ACL updates by using Scapy spoofed IP headers).
